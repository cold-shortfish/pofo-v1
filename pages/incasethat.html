      Wind, rain, gravity and light: the enemies of clothing are everywhere, waiting to catch an unassuming victim. A flash of skin elicits gasps and whispers. <span class="ict">In case that</span> is a proposal for the way clothing can function in very specific situations through toeing the line between practical and excessive. Each look in my thesis presents a solution or a reaction to a wardrobe malfunction, a seam tearing, wind blowing up a skirt, a downpour, and at the same time questions why these embarrassing situations only occur to women, as Google Images suggests.

<br><br>I have coded a website to present <span class="ict">in case that</span>, because I wanted to create an experience that was more immersive, that gives the viewer a more in depth view into my thought process for my thesis.  Because each outfit is a separate inquiry, I felt that it made more sense to present it this way where different ideas are explained on their own, but at the same time, the links within the website ties them together conceptually. 

<br><br>Please take a few minutes to explore the site. There’s no set path, on each page there are several places you can click on, an image or text, when the cursor turns into a pointer hand that leads you to the next. Try not to use the back button on the browser. I do not expect you to get through all of the pages or see everything. In fact, there’s no clear end as the site functions in a loop. A choose your own adventure kind of thing.
